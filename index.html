					<h1>What is Sexual Tourism?</h1>
					<p>The term “sexual tourism” is defined as travel for the specific purpose of having sex, typically with commercial sex workers. In this context, these travellers are referred to as “sex tourists”.</p>
					<p>Estimates from <a class='in-text-link' href="https://ecpat.org/" target='blank'>ECPAT International</a> show that each year, approximately 250,000 people travel internationally to engage in sex tourism with children and youth and that the industry generates over $20 billion in revenue.</p>

				<h1>Why Sexual Tourism is Problematic</h1>
				<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:</p>
				<div class='quote-box'>
					<p class='italic'>“Sex tourism supports human trafficking (slavery), one of the largest criminal industries in the world…Millions of children around the world are victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Children abused by sex tourists suffer not only sexual abuse but also physical, emotional, and psychological abuse, as well as poverty and homelessness. They suffer from health problems including addiction, malnourishment, injuries, STIs and emotional trauma.”</p>
				</div>	
				<p>Although sex workers make more money than other occupations available in their area, there are other, more effective ways to improve the lives of people, besides buying sex from them.</p>
				<p>
				For those who are trafficked, or bound to the trade by economic desperation, it is unfair that they should have to sacrifice the most personal areas of their bodies for the sake of someone’s vacation, ego, or fantasy whim.</p>
